At a high level, what does the board do for the bike?

Does the board have JTAG/SWD and UART?

If it doesn't have one of these, be sure to let them know that they are practically required for development.

If they don't' have enough pins to support one or both of these, reach out to your firmware lead to see if there's any way to get around using them.

What communication protocols does board use?

What devices are on the board that will need drivers?

Ask for datasheets for each of the devices.

Also be sure to ask if they can get breakout boards or EVMs (EValuation Modules) that we can use for driver development.

What other boards does the board communicate with?

What CAN messages does it need to send and receive?

Does the board have multiple states, or does it just operate in the same way the entire time?

If it has multiple states, you should work with them to develop a state machine.
