# DEV1-APDB

## Introduction
When the new APDB is added to DEV1, it will have a uC on it that the PVC will command over CAN. This should implement the same functionality that PVC currently has, but using CAN messages instead of GPIO signals. This will require working closely with the person developing the new APDB codebase and the integration team, which owns the startup sequence.
